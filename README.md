## Building an App Showing Recent News Articles
### HTML Files
**1. index.html**
- The main HTML page
- Will contain the layout and structure of the application, including the header, navigation bar, and main content section
- Will display the news articles

### Routes
**1. `/`**
- The main route for the application
- Will load the index.html file
- Will get the news articles from an external API (not included in the design)
- Will pass the news articles to the index.html file to be displayed

### Usage
- The Flask application will fetch news articles from an external API (not included in the design).
- The fetched articles will be passed to the index.html file.
- The index.html file will use Jinja2 templating to display the news articles in the main content section.

### Additional Notes
- The specific HTML and CSS code for the index.html file is not provided in this design, as it will depend on the desired design and layout of the news article display.
- The news API used to fetch the news articles is not specified, as it can vary based on availability and preference.
- The approach presented assumes that the news API provides a RESTful interface for fetching news articles. If the API uses a different protocol, the Flask application may need to be modified accordingly.
